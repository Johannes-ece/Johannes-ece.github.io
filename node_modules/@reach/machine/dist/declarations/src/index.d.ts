/**
 * This `useMachine` works very similiarly to what you get from `@xstate/react`
 * with some additions.
 *  - A second argument `refs` is passed to send all of our refs into our
 *    machine's contextual data object.
 *  - We wrap the `send` function so that refs are updated included in all of
 *    our events so we can use their current value (generally DOM nodes)
 *    anywhere in our actions.
 *  - We initialize the machine inside the component rather than throwing an
 *    error if an outside initializer creates a value that doesn't match. This
 *    is useful as some components may need a different initial state or some
 *    initial data based on props. We should *generally* just update the state
 *    with an event via useEffect and depend on a static initial value, but this
 *    is difficult if that initial value matters for SSR or to prevent some
 *    layout jank before the first paint. I don't think there's a problem with
 *    this approach, but we'll see what happens.
